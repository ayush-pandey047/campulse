Day1: 
        So i started this project after long time and i am happy with this.

        Now today i have make file structure as well as write some code. 

Purpose of files and folders which i have added:
    Frontend: This folder have all things related to Ui/Ux and ohter things.
        -> Src:
            -> components: resusable UI(i can use this on multiple place)
                    -> common: i will use 
            -> pages: Screen-level pages
            -> routes: route definitions
            -> context: auth and theme
            -> services: API calls
            -> utils: helpers

So the first issue came as in form of tailwind. It realy hard to find bcz in tailwind i am usig postcss.
So the issue is that i am using the older version code in index.css @tailwind and other things but what i have to do is in new version it import@tailwind. 
The older version   @tailwind base;
                    @tailwind components;
                    @tailwind utilities; 
Now the new version is @import "tailwindcss";
